LogParser.py

A program that parses all logs in a given path, and outputs results (into csv files) for the following:
- Machine (system) information (Work in progress)
- Memory usage statistics
- LogSpam (Work in progress)
- Hitch occurances and statistics 
- Error ocurrances and callstacks (Work in progress)
- Unit test results for the parsing operations (Work in progress)

Uses log files generated by CreateArbitraryLog.py as data source/s.

Identified areas for future extenstion:
- Develop logic to assess for duplicate log statements to be considered for log spam
- Develop logic to parse errors and thier [full] repective callstacks
- Allow users to pass arguments for preferred input directory
- Allow users to pass arguments for preferred output directory
- Allow users to pass arguments for what criteria to parse for
- Allow users to pass arguments for what file formats to store the results in
- Refactor for improved performance and algorithm design

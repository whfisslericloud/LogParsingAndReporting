# LogParsingAndReporting

Develop a series of tools to solve for:
- Creation of an "arbitrary log", since I have no access to proprietary logging as a data source
- Parsing of said log files for desired criteria/log statments
- Exporting of data metrics to files for future handling
- Develop means of reporting/visualizing instances and trends from the data metrics

See doc strings in files to understand more about what each script handles.

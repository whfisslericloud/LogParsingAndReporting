# LogParsingAndReporting

Develop a series of tools to solve for:
- Creation of an "arbitrary log", since I have no access to proprietary logging as a data source
- Parsing of said log files for desired criteria/log statments
- Exporting of data metrics to files for future handling
- Means of reporting/visualizing instances and trends from the data metrics (e.g. web server/dashboard front end)

See doc strings in files to understand more about what each script handles.

View "SampleData" folder for:
- log files created by CreateArbitraryLog.py
- error, hitch, memory csv reports parsed by LogParser.py
- run time log for LogParser.py while creating the csv reports
